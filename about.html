                    <p>
                        Hello, my name is Jeffrey and I am a graduate from 
                        <abbr title="Florida International University">FIU</abbr> with a bachelors in computer science.
                        I have built this website to showcase my projects and skills while also
                        having a personal project of maintaining a website built with html and css.
                        <br>In my freetime i enjoy taking on personal projects such as this personal website,
                        purely for my own usage. In similar fashion, I have built my ios app called
                        MMAlert which I took the time to build for my own personal usage. I am a huge
                        mixed martial arts fan and needed an ios app that would alert me of when
                        mma events would be starting. There were no other apps that had this usage for me so I decided
                        to take on the app development myself and it has resulted in a fully functioning ios app that
                        fills that niche. 
                    </p>
